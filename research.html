	<h3>Accretion disks formed from tidally disrupted companions of AGB stars</h3>
		<p>Nordhaus 2011 outlines an explanation for High Field Magnetic White Dwarfs. 
		If the post AGB star was part of a binary system then during the radial expantion,
		the binary could experience orbital decay as a result of envelope drag. it is
		 possible that if the orbit decays to where the companions self gravity 
		is surpassed by the differential potential from the central star. 
		Companion will be tidally disrupted and the debris will form an accretion disk. 
		My project currently is to explore the stability of such an accretion disk and
		to determine if it is possible for the accretion disk to deposit a stong enough magnetic field to explain the exitance of High Field Magnetic White Dwarfs.</p>
