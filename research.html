  <h2>Current Projects</h2>
	
	<p>My Research intrests include: Computational MHD, Mathematics, and Plasma Physics. I am also just generally interested in becomming a skilled programmer</p>
	<h3>Accretion disks formed from tidally disrupted companions of AGB stars</h3>
		<p>Nordhaus 2011 outlines an explanation for High Field Magnetic White Dwarfs. 
		If the post AGB star was part of a binary system then during the radial expantion,
		the binary could experience orbital decay as a result of envelope drag. it is
		 possible that if the orbit decays to where the companions self gravity 
		is surpassed by the differential potential from the central star. 
		Companion will be tidally disrupted and the debris will form an accretion disk. 
		My project currently is to explore the stability of such an accretion disk and
		to determine if it is possible for the accretion disk to deposit a stong enough magnetic field to explain the exitance of High Field Magnetic White Dwarfs.</p>
	<h3>Reverse Engineering and Modeling R-Sculptoris</h3>
		<p>R-Sculptoris is an semi-regular AGB star. When imaged by ALMA this object reveals a clear and beautiful spriral sructure indicitve of a companion. With the collaberation of Zhou Chen I am estimating the binary parameters
		 using obervational data, simulating the dynamics in astroBEAR , and generating synthetic images with Rad3DMC. 
		With this process we hope to generate a confidently guess the binary parameters of this system.</p>
	<h3>Point Cloud Registration</h3>
		<p>Using an Intel Realsence Camera I am working with my brother creating a mountable module to 
		scan roads for potholes. This project involves innovating efficient algorithems to accuratly reconstruct 3D surface maps from raw distance measurments.
		I also make use of CAD modeling to design and 3D print the fixtures for all componests of this module.
