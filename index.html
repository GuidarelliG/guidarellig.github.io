<h2>Research Intrests:</h2>
<p>My research focuses on creating 3D simulations to investigate, refine, and extend current thoeries about astrophysical objects. Some objects that I look at specifically are High Field Magnetic White Dwarfs <a href = "https://www.pnas.org/content/108/8/3135">(HFMWDs)</a> and the Asymptotic Giant Branch  <a href = "https://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr03/sb0307.html">(AGB)</a> star  <a href = "https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1239/"> R Sculptoris</a>. With these objects I find plausable thoeries about thier origin and put them to the test using the multi-physics code <a href = "https://astrobear.pas.rochester.edu/trac/">AstroBEAR </a>. The research tab on this website has slightly more information and cool graphics. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions about my research or just want more information.</p>

<p>In a much less professional capacity my other intrests manifest themselfs in several pet projects: (Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for stock market prediction -> stock market simulation with sampling of variously trained agents.) (Point Cloud Registration (PCR) for modular pot hole scanner) (Collatz conjecture vizualizations) (Prime Number Visualization)(Top down video game) (Woodworking) [Links to come]</p>
